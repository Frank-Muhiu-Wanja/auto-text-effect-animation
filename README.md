# auto-text-effect-animation
That code makes a typing animation where words like YouTuber, Web Developer, Freelancer, Instructor appear letter by letter inside the .container, then switch to the next word in a loop.
✨ Effect in action:

The text inside .container will show:
I am a Y → I am a Yo → I am a You … → I am a YouTuber

Then it switches:
I am a W → … → I am a Web Developer

Then I am a Freelancer

Then I am an Instructor

And loops forever.
